# zeta_disease_prediction

### INTRODUCTION

Mars Mission Control needs a good data-driven system for predicting Zeta Disease infection on the International Mars Colony.
Use the `_zeta-disease_training-data_` dataset to build a model that can predict who will be infected by Zeta Disease.
Apply your model to the `_zeta-disease_prediction-data_` dataset to predict who will be infected by Zeta Disease.

### DATASET

The dataset includes 9 columns with information on 800 people.
1.	age : in years
2.	weight : body weight in pounds (lbs)
3.	bmi : Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)
4.	blood_pressure : resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
5.	insulin_test : inuslin test value
6.	liver_stress_test : liver_stress_test value
7.	cardio_stress_test : cardio_stress_test value
8.	years_smoking : number of years of smoking
9.	zeta_disease :
              1 = yes;
              0 = no
              
  Mar's Mission Control Zeta Prediction.ipynb is the jupyter notebook which has all the results.  
  final_predictions.csv is the csv file which contains the predictions on the new dataset.  
  zeta_training_set.csv is the training data file.  
  zeta_prediction_set.csv is the newly introduced test file.
